 Warning: the number of valence electrons in pseudopotential > 1 for Li: [He] 2s1
 Pseudopotentials with additional electrons can yield (more) accurate outcomes, but may be less efficient.
 If you're confident that your chosen pseudopotential is appropriate, you can safely ignore this warning.

 Largest gradient in force is 0.00000 eV/A.
 Threshold is 0.0500000 eV/A.

 Relaxation is converged!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 Relaxation is converged, but the SCF is unconverged! The results are unreliable.. 

 It is suggested to increase the maximum SCF step and/or perform the relaxation again.
